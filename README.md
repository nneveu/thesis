Nicole's PhD thesis


Useful git commands: 

git clone https://github.com/nneveu/thesis.git (download a fresh copy of thesis materials)

git pull origin master (this updates the local directory with changes only)

git status (shows you what you have added or commited or if you are up to date)


How to add changes: 

git add "thesis.tex" (this adds your local edits)

git commit -m "Message about edits" (this comines all edits and gets ready to send them)

git push origin master (this pushes your edits to the remote directory, now anyone can see them)
