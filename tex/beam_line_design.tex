\Chapter{Beam Line Design}\label{chp:4}%________________________________


\Section{Introduction}

Independent staging requires two drive beam lines, with routing of bunch trains via a kicker and septum, 
see Figure \ref{fig:full-staging}. The kicker and septum must direct the beam to a dipole, 
that will straighten the beam trajectory to travel parallel to the original beam path. 
In this configuration the two drive beam lines will be parallel to each other after the dipole.
Several quadrupoles are required to control the beam size, and deliver the desired beam parameters
at the small aperture of the PETS decelerating structure. 
This includes a small transverse size of the beam to allow 100\% transmission, 
and a small bunch length to maximize power extraction from the PETS.
Spectrometer magnets are used to measure the energy of the beam at the end of the beam lines.
This second independent beam line design has been completed. 
Installation and testing of the kicker has been done.  
The remaining components have been specified, and several are now ready for installation (i.e. septum, quadrupoles, dipoles).

A kicker design from Indiana University (IU) was used as a base line to design a kicker specific to the
requirements at the AWA. The gap and plate length had to be determined based on the beam energy, 
readily available equipment, and mechanical constraints in the AWA tunnel. 
After a design was set, the kicker was fabricated.
Two vacuum tests were performed to verify the fabrication process was successful.
The electronics group at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) provided equipment and helped perform these tests.
The tests included a high voltage (HV) test and Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) measurement.
Both tests were intended to verify the electrical properties of the kicker were acceptable for operation at HV.
After these tests, the kicker was installed and tested with low and high charge beams. 
The provided angle was found to be linear with respect to the voltage of the pulser.  
The angle was slightly lower than the simulation result, probably due to reflections at the
connection between the cables and kicker plates. 
The septum design was specified based on simulation work and the kicker angle.
The magnet design was completed at the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP), 
where it was also fabricated. 

The beam line optics also had to be determined and optimized.
The optics include four quadrupoles after the accelerating cavities, 
two quadrupoles on the bent beam line, and three focusing quadrupoles
before the PETS structure.
A point to point matrix calculation was done to ensure that transport of the
beam was possible through the desired kicker gap.  This was followed by an optimization 
performed using the OPAL code and a built-in genetic algorithm. 
There were optimization results in several optics scenarios that can transport 
the beam through the PETS with 100\% transmission.  

This chapter will start with a discussion of the design considerations for the kicker modification for the AWA facility.  
This is followed by a description of the hardware tests done before the kicker installation.  
Simulations relevant to the kicker design will be presented, and compared to beam measurement results.  
The chosen optics design based on the optimization studies will then be presented.


\Section{Kicker Design Theory} \label{theory}

A fast rise time kicker is needed to separate the 
bunch trains supplied by the drive gun.  When the kicker is on, 
bunches passing though it are deflected into an alternate beam line by the kicker field.
The spacing between bunch trains is on the order of nanoseconds; 
it must be long enough to allow the kicker to reach full field before the arrival of the second bunch train, 
and also depends on the layout of the beam lines and laser timing.  
The drive beam and the accelerated `witness' beam must be synchronized so that the 
acceleration field is maximum when the witness beam arrives at the accelerating structure.
Magnetic options for transverse bunch train separation, 
such as a dipole, were disqualified due to their slow rise times 

Borrowing from a successful neighbor, a design implemented by Indiana University (IU) \cite{iukicker}
was adapted to fit the TBA requirements at the AWA. Redesign required consideration
of the length and gap between the kicker plates. Both are key parameters that determine 
what angle the beam will be deflected. Longer plates result in the beam traveling 
in the electromagnetic field for a longer time yielding a larger beam deflection angle. 
A smaller gap increases the field intensity for a given voltage (similar to a parallel plate 
capacitor), increasing the beam deflection angle. 


The kicker is essentially a parallel plate waveguide. 
A $\pm$\SI{30}{kV} power supply can be used to induce a maximum of \SI{60}{kV} potential difference 
across the plates. Each plate will be terminated in a $50\,\Omega$ load.  
The combination of the two plates will result in a static TEM mode 
between the plates. The electric field, $E_x$, and magnetic field, $B_y$,
can be derived from the voltage or current. The electric field, $E_x$, due to a potential, $V$, is: 
\begin{equation}
E_x=\frac{V}{h},
\end{equation}
where h is the gap height. From Maxwell's equations, we know that the electric and magnetic 
field are related by the speed of light, $c$, in the case of plane and TEM waves \cite{pozar}. 
From this we can find the magnetic field induced between the plates: 
\begin{equation}
B_y=\frac{E_x}{c}.
\label{Bv}
\end{equation}
The electrons are traveling at nearly the speed of light, $c$, and move through the kicker on a 
trajectory perpendicular to the fields.  Plugging Equation \ref{Bv} into the Lorentz force equation, 
it is shown that the force exerted on a charge, $q$, 
from the electric and magnetic fields of the TEM mode are equal: 
\begin{equation}
F=q\,(E_x+v\times B_y),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	F = q \,\left(E_x+c\times \frac{E_x}{c}\right).
\end{equation}

Since the force due to the electric field is equal and oriented in the same direction as the force due to the magnetic field, 
the total kick is twice that from either field alone.  
The angle induced by electric and magnetic fields has been calculated in \cite{iukicker, Wiedemann}
and is rewritten in the following terms:  
\begin{equation}
\theta_E= \frac{V\,L}{h\,T},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\theta_B= \frac{B\,L}{B\rho},
\end{equation}
where L is the plate length, and T is the kinetic energy of the beam. 
Rigidity, or $B\rho$, is a common accelerator physics term that can be found in text such as Wiedemann \cite{Wiedemann}. 
It is a convenient way to relate the magnetic field and trajectory of an energetic beam traveling through that field:
\begin{equation}
	B\rho=3.33564\,\,T\, \text{[GeV-Tesla]}.
\end{equation} 
For a constant magnetic field, as the beam energy increases, the angle decreases. 
The beam is considered ``rigid'' at higher energies, 
and requires stronger magnetic fields to achieve the same angle, or bending radius ($\rho$).

Using the definitions above, the total angle provided by the kicker is then: 
\begin{equation}
\theta_k = \theta_{total}= \theta_E+\theta_B=2\theta_E=2\theta_B.
\end{equation}
The expected deflection, or x offset after the kicker, can be calculated
using geometry in Figure~\ref{fig:kicker-geometry}, and the expected angle of deflection:

	\label{fig:kicker-geometry}
\end{figure*}
\begin{equation}
\rho = \Delta x + x \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \rho - \rho \cos \theta_k \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\triangle x = \left(1-\cos\theta_{k}\right)\rho \, ,
	\label{eq:kx}
\end{equation}
Where $\rho$, is the bending radius, $\Delta x$ is the beam offset at the exit of the kicker, 
and $\theta_{k}$ was is the total angle provided by the kicker. 

From these equations, we relate the design parameters gap height, length of the plates, and 
the kinetic energy of the beam. Next, further beam line considerations were included 
to narrow down what angle the kicker needed to supply. 
The largest drive beam energy achievable at the AWA is \SI{75}{MeV}. 
Therefore the kinetic energy of the beam, T, was set as a constant.
Next mechanical constraints were considered. The two drive beam lines need to be separated
by at least \SI{0.5}{m} so that magnets (quadrupoles and dipoles) can fit on each 
beam line without competing for transverse space.

			The angle provided by the kicker, $\theta_k$, plus the angle provided by the septum, $\theta_s$,
		    must be less than or equal to $20^\circ$.
			The two beam lines must also be at least \SI{0.5}{m} apart.}\label{fig:triangle}
\end{figure*}

Using geometry as shown in Figure \ref{fig:triangle}, an upper limit on the 
combined kicker and septum angle ($\theta_k+\theta_s$) is based on the existing dipoles at the AWA.
The maximum dipole bend angle, $\theta_d$, is $20^\circ$. 
Therefore, $\theta_{total}$  must be less than $20^\circ$. 
That way the bent beam line can be straightened out using a standard dipole, 
which is readily available at the AWA. 
It is also safer to design away from the limit of the equipment. 
Therefore a bend angle less than $20^\circ$ is preferred and allows room for tolerance errors. 
This has the added benefit of reducing energy spread. 
If the beam is bent at a smaller angle, 
less coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and transverse position spread will be induced.

Using the equations from Section \ref{theory}, 
tables were made for different plate lengths giving possible gap, angle, and x offset values for comparison. 
The maximum beam energy was used, \SI{75}{MeV}, and the expected pulsar voltage was used, \SI{35}{kV}.
Kicker lengths of \SI{0.42}{m}, \SI{0.5}{m}, and \SI{0.6}{m} were investigated.
From these calculations, the range of possible kicker angles fell between \SI{1}{^\circ} and \SI{3}{^\circ}.
The longest kicker plate option was investigated further with the understanding that 
a larger kicker angle would shorten the drift distance between the kicker and septum, 
and the results for this configuration are shown in Table \ref{tab:kickparam}.
A shorter drift would mean less divergence in the beam before it reaches the next focusing optic (quadrupole).

Next simulations were done to give an estimation of the beam size at the entrance and exit of the kicker.
Typical operating conditions at the AWA were used: accelerating cavities on crest, buck focusing at \SI{500}{A}, 
matching solenoid at \SI{255}{A}, and quadrupoles nearly in a 1:2:1 configuration with \SI{1.7}{A} and \SI{-3.3}{A}.
These are not optimized running conditions, which gives a good upper bound for how the beam will behave before tuning.
An angle of \SI{2}{^\circ} was chosen, as a reasonable starting point based on the values in Table \ref{tab:kickparam}. 
\begin{figure}

	\end{center} 
	\caption{Simulation of the transverse size of a \SI{40}{nC} 
			beam at the entrance and exit of proposed kicker configuration.}
	\label{fig:beamsizekicker}
\end{figure}  
The resulting beam sizes were about \SI{15}{mm} to \SI{19}{mm} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:beamsizekicker}. 
This requires that the kicker gap be comfortably larger than \SI{20}{mm}, 
and have room for the beam centroid deflection that the kicker will cause.
The gap needed to be large enough to allow the full width of the beam to pass through while allowing extra room
for the transverse offset of the beam as it exits the kicker. 

At this point, it was clear the gap needed to be larger than \SI{30}{mm}, 
due to the beam size at \SI{40}{nC}. Around this time, 
it was also learned that the maximum pulsar voltage was $\pm$ \SI{30}{kV},
not $\pm$ \SI{35}{kV} as expected. 
These two factors would drive the possible kick angle below \SI{2}{^\circ}, 
if the kicker plates remained the same length.
The next question was whether to push for a larger angle by elongating the kicker plates, 
or whether plate gap values at \SI{40}{mm} and above were sufficient, see Table \ref{tab:kickparam}.
Additional mechanical constraints between the kicker and septum were considered. 
One beam pipe will connect the two and the deflected and undeflected 
beams must travel in the same pipe until reaching the septum.
After the septum, the two beams will separate into their own beam pipes.
This connection piece before the split, is a custom vacuum chamber designed at 
AWA by Scott Doran, and ordered from MDC Vacuum Products. 
The large chamber requires more vacuum pumping than other areas, 
which could complicate installation if the chamber were too long. 
In this regard, a larger angle from the kicker would help by shortening the pipe length between the kicker and septum.
Therefore, it was decided to elongate the kicker plates to accommodate the larger gap width and still achieve \SI{2}{^\circ}.

	\end{center}
\end{table}

After a discussion on fabrication techniques and the mechanical constraints in Table~\ref{tab:mechanical}, 
it was noted that the maximum kicker plate length could be \SI{1}{m}. 
It was also determined from measurements in Chapter~\ref{chp:exp}, 
that the beam energy in the TBA configuration is closer to \SI{65}{MeV}, 
rather than the theoretical maximum of \SI{75}{MeV}.
This is a results of asymmetries in the cavities and the distribution of power
between the witness and drive lines.
A new table of voltages and angles were calculated. At this plate length, 
a gap width of \SI{40}{mm} provided roughly \SI{2}{^\circ} of kick again. 
This angle would satisfy the one inch pipe inner diameter spacing in the septum as well. 

For a length of \SI{1}{m}, and gap of \SI{40}{mm}, 
several beam energy and angle scenarios were considered.
As a contingency plan, it was important to consider if the 
beam energy could be lowered to still achieve the desired 
angle and x offset required in the TBA beam line. 
In other words, if the kicker were unable to deliver a \SI{2}{^\circ}
kick for a \SI{65}{MeV}, could the energy be lowered to still achieve
a fully staged TBA demonstration. 
With the pulsar output being variable between 18 and 30 kV,
several feasible options were calculated using the equations in Section \ref{theory}, 
and are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:kickerangles} and \ref{fig:kickeroffset}.

As a double check on the first order calculations in Figures \ref{fig:kickerangles} and \ref{fig:kickeroffset}, 
a PIC simulation was done to estimate the beam 
trajectory in the kicker and septum. 
This work includes RF cavities and space charge effects.
The two estimates match within reason, see Figure \ref{fig:beamtraj}.

\Section{Preliminary Kicker Tests}

After the design of the kicker was finalized, fabrication began at ANL.
The copper plates and ceramic brackets were fabricated on site at the ANL shops.
High voltage (HV) feedthroughs and cables were purchased from FID GmbH. 
In order to test that the fabrication of the kicker was sound, members of the 
Advanced Photon Source (APS) electronics groups graciously helped perform an 
out of vacuum AC high voltage test. Afterwards they also helped perform and 
analyze a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) measurement of the kicker plates
to determine the impedance along the kicker plates, feedthroughs, and cables.

\Subsection{High Voltage Kicker Test}
Two HV tests were performed at the APS. This was done to ensure the electrical connection 
between the feedthroughs and kicker plates were free of shorts. 
The first test consisted of HV applied in increments to ports 3 and 4 on the kicker.  
Ports 1 and 2 were shorted to ground. There was no leakage current up to \SI{8}{kV} RMS.
The second test reversed the set up with 3 and 4 grounded and ports 1 and 2 exposed. 
There was no leakage current up to \SI{9}{kV} RMS, which was the maximum voltage of the test equipment.
Figure~\ref{fig:AWAHVkicker} shows the connection and location of the kicker in the APS Faraday cage.

		\label{fig:AWAHVkicker}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\Subsection{Time Domain Reflectometer Test}
After the HV test was completed, a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) measurement was preformed at the APS~\cite{TDR}, 
with the help of C.~Y.~Yao, A.~Brill, X.~Sun and C.~Jing.
This technique measures reflections along a conductor and gives information about discontinuities in the line being measured. 
This information was used to determine the impedance along the cables, feedthroughs, and plates of the kicker. 
Ideally, the response would be \SI{50}{\ohm} to reduce reflections and resulting power loss. 
The measurements, plotted by C.~Y.~Yao in Figure \ref{fig:TDR}, show a larger impedance at the feedthrough locations.
Due to resource and time constraints, it was a goal to use off the shelf parts where possible in fabrication of the kicker.
Therefore, the feedthrough mismatch is expected because they were not specifically designed to couple to the plate geometry.
A substantial amount of time and resources were spent to minimize reflections for the APS kickers plotted in Figure \ref{fig:TDR}.
However, that kicker still deviates from \SI{50}{\ohm} near the feedthroughs.
Given this comparison to the kickers fabricated at the APS, C.~Y.~Yao advised the mismatch we observed was not dangerous to 
the pulsar or cables that would drive the kicker.  
The only negative result is the reduced amount of voltage supplied to the plates, and therefore, a reduction in the kick given to the beam.

\Section{Measurement of Beam Deflection}

Once the kicker was installed, measurements were done to verify it worked as designed with beam.  
The voltage was scanned to check for linearity of the beam offset with voltage.  
The beam size and angle of deflection were measured and compared to simulation results.  
Details of the set up, and results of the studies follow.

The kicker was installed in the AWA drive beam line approximately \SI{16.5}{m} downstream of the cathode.
The HV pulsar was located on the roof of the bunker.
During the beam tests the accelerator was operated in TBA-like conditions with machine settings based on simulations 
done to optimize for future TBA runs, see Table~\ref{tab:krunparam}.

		the angle provided by the kicker for a \SI{30}{nC} beam at \SI{65}{MeV}.}
	\label{fig:kyag}
\end{figure*}
The centroid position of the beam was measured for several kicker voltages, and a linear fit was performed.
The R value for the fit in Figure \ref{fig:linear} is 0.99704. This shows that the beam offset 
is fairly linear with respect to kicker voltage. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/kicker_linearity}
	\caption{Measured deflection of beam due to kicker at several voltages.}
	\label{fig:linear}
\end{figure}

Using the x offset numbers found in Figure~\ref{fig:linear}, 
the measured angle vs. first order approximations from Section~\ref{theory} can be compared . 
Note the x offset seen on the YAG screen is not solely due to the trajectory in the kicker.
The contributions to the total deflection must be broken into two parts: the deflection of the beam inside the kicker, 
and the position change when the beam is drifting towards the YAG screen after it exits the kicker.
The latter part can be approximated using the triangle shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kicker-geometry}.
\lsnote{{\it Using that figure, tan(thetak) = ldrift/deltax, so it seems like you need ldrift/tan(thetak) in the  following equation, instead of a product.}} Inside the kicker, the trajectory is approximated using Equation~\ref{eq:kx}. 
Combining these two terms, the equation for the x offset seen during the experiment
can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \Delta x_{kicker} + \Delta x_{drift}\, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \left(1-\cos\theta_{k}\right)\rho + \frac{L_{drift}}{\tan \theta_{k}}\, ,
	\label{eq:kdata}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the bending radius in the kicker, and $L_{drift}$ is \SI{0.28}{m} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kyag}.
Using the small angle approximation, this equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \rho - \rho \left(1-\frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) + L_{drift} \theta_{k},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \rho \frac{\theta^2}{2} + L_{drift} \theta_{k}.
\end{equation}
Next, $\rho$ is rewritten assuming the the arc length is approximately equal 
to the length of the kicker plates:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \frac{L_{kicker}}{\theta_{k}}\frac{\theta_{k}^2}{2} + L_{drift}\theta_{k},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \left(\frac{L_{kicker}}{2}+ L_{drift}\right)\theta_{k},
\end{equation}
where the length of the kicker is \SI{1}{m} and the drift is \SI{0.28}{m}:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x = \SI{0.78}{m}\,\,\theta_{k}.
		\label{eq:kdx}
\end{equation}
The position offset on the YAG screen due to the kicker, $\Delta x$, 
was measured and the data is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:linear}. 
Note, the beam centroid location at kicker voltage $=0$, 
represents the beam location on the YAG screen when the kicker is turned off.
This is used as a reference point to calculate $\Delta x$ at each voltage value
(i.e. $\Delta x_i = x_{vi} - x_{v0}$).
With these $\Delta x$ values, Equation~\ref{eq:kdata} can be rewritten to 
solve for the experimentally achieved angle $\theta_{k}$.

Next the energy measurement was analyzed to determine the beam energy. 
The method described in Chapter \ref{chp:exp} was used, 
and the current measured to bend the beam \SI{15}{^\circ} was about \SI{9}{A}.
This corresponds to an energy of about \SI{62}{MeV}. 
This energy was then used to calculate the ideal angle values vs. kicker voltage.
The are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:angles} in comparison 
to the ideal values for a \SI{65}{MeV} beam. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/kicker_angle_comparison}
	\caption{Measured angle provided by the kicker at several voltages.  
	These are compared to 1st order calculations for a \SI{65}{MeV} beam.
	Smaller angles are expected in the data due to the reflections
	seen at the feedthroughs in TDR measurements, see Figure~\ref{fig:TDR}.
	Note the calculated values are also smaller than the 
	angles predicted in Figure~\ref{fig:kickerangles}, 
	because the final kicker gap after assembly was \SI{45}{mm}, a little larger
	than the design value of \SI{40}{mm}}
	\label{fig:angles}
\end{figure}

Beam size data on the YAG screen after the kicker was taken, 
see Figure \ref{fig:kickerbeamsize} for examples of this data. 
These measurements were used to calculate the total beam size and 
centroid location of the beam. A combination fit was used to extract 
the beam sizes as described in Section~\ref{sec:beamsize}. 
A Gaussian fit was used for the beam core, and linear fits were used for the tails.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/yag6_kicker_voltage0}%

	\caption{Examples of beam size data taken during kicker test. 
		Various kicker voltage settings were used and deflection of the beam was observed.}
	\label{fig:kickerbeamsize}
\end{figure}
The kicker slightly increases the beam size in the kicked direction (x), 
but the large discrepancy in the horizontal and vertical beam size can not be attributed to the kicker alone.
If the asymmetries were due to the kicker only, they would not be present when the kicker is off.
Persistence of the asymmetry when the kicker is off (voltage = 0) indicates 
the source of error is not an intrinsic problem associated with the kicker.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/xybeamsizes_high_charge_kicker_scan_angle_asymmetric}
	\caption{Beam size data taken during kicker voltage scan. Asymmetry between the x and y beam sizes
		 is present even when the kicker is off at V = 0. This suggests the asymmetry is not
	     caused by the kicker alone. Scans of the gun voltage showed large impact on the beam sizes
     	 and is probably the source of the majority of the asymmetry in the x and y dimensions.
	 The gun gradient to get the simulation values shown in this figure was \SI{55}{MV/m}.} 
     \label{fig:beamsize}
\end{figure}

There are several possible sources of the asymmetric beam size. 
These include the initial laser profile (which was not exactly symmetric
when the data was taken), field strengths in the accelerating cavities, 
and uncertainties in the quadrupoles strengths.
The solenoid field is excluded due to a recent measurement of the magnetic field, 
done by G. Ha and E. Wisniewski at the AWA. 
To check the laser radius contribution, simulations with symmetric and asymmetric laser cross-sections were done.
The difference in the x beam size in these two cases was only \SI{0.3}{mm} rms. 
Therefore, this is not the major contributing factor.

Next, several gradient values in the gun were simulated. 
This parameter had a strong impact on the beam sizes, with a range of \SI{1.5}{mm} 
in the x direction and \SI{0.3}{mm} in the y direction.
It's clear the field strength and asymmetries in the RF field map 
are strongly affecting the results presented in Figure~\ref{fig:beamsize}.
Details of the simulation set up for these tests can be found in Appendix~\ref{gunsims}.
The gradient that achieved the agreement seen in Figure~\ref{fig:beamsize} was \SI{55}{MV/m}.
This is considerably lower than the reported AWA maximum gradient of \SI{85}{MV/m}.
It is possible that the lower gradient and resulting asymmetric beam size effect is 
due to a distribution of lower gradients in the cavities. 
In other words, perhaps the the gradient in the gun is not that low, but rather
the gradients in the gun and all six linac cavities are slightly lower than expected.

In conclusion, there are several contributing factors to the asymmetries in the beam.
From simulations, the laser radius mismatch contributes an estimated \SI{0.3}{mm} of difference 
between the x and y dimensions. Also in simulation, a difference of about \SI{1.5}{mm} 
is attributed to the gun gradient and asymmetries in the RF fields. 
This is an unexpected and meaningful result for the AWA, and will inform experiments moving forward.
Finally, there is a variance of ~\SI{0.5}{mm} attributed to the kicker through analysis of the 
data shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beamsize}.
Note, these errors are not a major hurdle for TBA experiments, as they can
be mitigated with precise control of the quadrupoles.


\Section{TBA Beam Line}

While the kicker and septum parameters were defined by the constraints discussed above, 
the optics must be used to address the aperture limits further down stream.
There were three clear goals TBA beam line configuration: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve 100\% transmission in the PETS
	\item Achieve the smallest bunch length possible
	\item Arrange the beam line for quick and easy installation
\end{itemize}

With the third item partially addressed (see Section~\ref{theory}), 
it remained to determine if an optics solution exists that can satisfy the 
first two requirements (transmission and bunch length). 
In the case of bunch length, there was no set goal, but a clear understanding 
that a shorter bunch will generate more power in the PETS structures [ref here]. 
\lsnote{{\it <-Put in a reference or remove} Since the PETS } 
The structure aperture of \SI{17.6}{mm} is roughly three times smaller than the rest of the beam line, 
care must be taken to achieve good transmission there.

As a first check of the rough design, a point to point matrix calculation was done 
to determine if the beam size could be maintained near the kicker.
Next the simulation studies presented in Chapter~\ref{simulations} were used as a  
base line for the final optimization. The genetic algorithm in OPAL
was used to achieve the optics design required for testing fully staged TBA. 
Solutions were found that meet the requirements listed above.


\Subsection{Point to Point Check}
The effect of a beam line component (such as a dipole, quadrupole, or straight beam pipe) on the phase space coordinates of a particle can be modeled as a matrix operator~\cite{brown,Wiedemann}.  These building blocks may be ``stacked'' to determine the effect of an entire beam line, or section of a beam line, on the coordinates of a  particle.  
These common building blocks were used as a check that the 
beam properties after the first four quadrupoles 
would allow transport through the kicker (see Figure~\ref{fig:full-staging}),
\begin{figure*}

	\caption{Simplified drawing of a point to point optics configuration for quadruplet telescope model.}
		\label{fig:p2p}
\end{figure*}
by establishing that the beam size could be maintained near the kicker during transport.  
Four quadruple strengths and the five distances between the quadrupoles are parameters under consideration. 
To reduce the number of variables from ten to four, the drift lengths are set to be sums of focal lengths, as in
the quadruplet telescope module described by K. Brown in \cite{brown}.  
The transfer matrix $R$, is defined as:  
\begin{equation}
	R_q =  R_{d5}  \cdot R_{q4} \cdot   R_{d4} \cdot R_{q3} \cdot R_{d3} \cdot R_{q2} \cdot R_{d2} \cdot R_{q1} \cdot R_{d1}, 
\label{kb1}
\end{equation}
where a matrix with the subscript d refers to a drift as defined by,
\begin{equation}
R_{d_i} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & L_i \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
and a matrix with subscript q refers to a quadrupole as defined by,
\begin{equation}
R_{q_i} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\pm \frac{1}{f_i} & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Substitution and matrix multiplication results in a transfer matrix of the 
the following form for the quadruplet:
\begin{equation}
R_q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{f_2 f_4}{f_1 f_3} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{f_1 f_3}{f_2 f_4}	
\end{bmatrix},\label{kb2}
\end{equation}
where $f_1 \ldots f_4$ stand for the focal lengths of each quad before the kicker. 
Due to other experiments in the AWA tunnel, 
the first quadrupole was required to be at least $\SI{3}{m}$ away from the exit of the 
last accelerating cavity in the linac. This gives the initial drift length and value
for $f_1$, see Figure~\ref{fig:p2p}.
To achieve point to point transport of the beam as described in~\cite{brown}, 
we can equate $f_1 = f_4$ and $f_2 = f_3$. This reduces Equation~\ref{kb2} to:
\begin{equation}
R_q =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1	
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
The problem set-up can be further simplified by assuming $f_1=f_2$. 
Given the total distance, D, available for the
quads in the beam line, \SI{3.8}{m}, and referring to Figure~\ref{fig:p2p}, 
an equation is written to solve for the focal length $f_1$: 
\begin{align}
D = 2 \left(f_1+f_2+f_3+f_4\right)\\
= 4f_1 + 4 f_2 \\
8f_1 = \SI{3.8}{m} \\
f_1 = \SI{0.475}{m}
\end{align}.

For completion, the focal length is converted into a field strength 
to determine whether or not this configuration is possible given 
the currently installed hardware at the AWA: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{f} = kl\, ,
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the quadrupole's effective length, and k is the gradient with respect to  
the beam energy and magnet strength \cite{Wiedemann}: \lsnote{{\it There is a problem with the units in the following equation.  k should have units of $1/m^{2}$, so that kl has units of 1/m.  It looks like you have a mix of the $1/Brho$ and $e/p$ forms.}}
\begin{equation}
k = \SI{0.2998}{} \frac{g[\SI{}{T/m}]}{p [\SI{}{GeV/c}]}\label{k}.
\end{equation}
The beam energy and the effective length of the quadrupole are needed for a numerical estimate of 
the quadrupole gradient needed to maintain the beam size at the kicker. 
Given an energy of \SI{65}{MeV}, a quadrupole length of \SI{11}{cm}, 
and Equation~\ref{k} we can calculate this configuration would require a 
magnet strength of \SI{\pm4.14}{T/m}. This is feasible considering the 
max strength is \SI{\pm9}{T/m}. This also gives some indication 
that there should be several possible solutions found during optimization
since the point to point check is not at either extreme of the quadrupole limits.


\Section{TBA Beam Line Optics Optimization}\label{failed}
 
With the kicker and septum design set, 
and the basic geometry of the beam line laid out, 
an optimization of the beam line optics was performed.
This was done for two reasons. First, to confirm that solutions 
exist at \SI{40}{nC} that allow the beam to be transmitted at 100\% through the PETS structure in the deflected beam line.
Second, from the set of feasible solutions, the optics designs with the smallest bunch lengths should be identified.
These two conditions combined will provide an optics solution that provides the most power output from the PETS structure for acceleration of the witness beam. 

The built-in GA in OPAL was again used for these simulations. 
Several rounds of optimizations were tried and many failed for various reasons, 
some of which include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item using too many objectives (7+)
	\item including too many design variables (15+)
	\item over constraint of the objective values (upper bound too small at \SI{0.1}{mm} for beam sizes)
	\item using bad hyper parameters
	\item setting the first optimization point upstream near the linac
\end{itemize}
All iterations can be found in the following repository:
\begin{center}
	\url{https://github.com/nneveu/awa-tba}
\end{center}
which also houses all plotting and simulation scripts used in this chapter.

Some drawbacks of using a GA, are that many simulation parameters 
must be decided empirically after trial and error.
This can be computationally expensive, 
and there is no clear guidance on what type of problem set up will be 
best for unique optimization problems such as the beam dynamics in this case.
Luckily, ANL provides excellent computational resources \cite{lcrc}, and
the availability of compute time was not a limiting factor in this work.

\Subsection{Optimization Setup}\label{setup}
The most successful optimization problem to date entailed minimizing the 
3D beam size, transverse momentum, and energy spread at the fifth quarupole on the drive line.
Three constraints were used to limit the maximum beam size and asymmetry (transverse roundness) considered by the algorithm.
The difference in x and y was included as a constraint, because failed optimization runs in the 
past had converged on solutions that had a very small beam size in x, and an unrealistic and large 
beam size in y. This constraint was added to avoid this error.
In general, constraints serve as a way to eliminate clearly undesirable results and exclude them 
from the algorithm that determines which individuals are fit.

All objectives and constraints are shown in Table~\ref{tab:opt-tba-obj}. 
Constraints were evaluated at the entrance of the kicker at \SI{16.5}{m}, and
objectives were minimized \SI{19.4}{m} after the cathode. 
\begin{table}%[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Objectives (beam parameters of interest) and constraints used during large scale optimization runs.

		(entrance of the fifth quadrupole).}

That is the location of the first quadrupole between the septum and kicker, see Figure~\ref{fig:full-staging}.
Optimizing at this location helps reduce dispersion by minimizing 
the energy spread before the beam enters the $15^\circ$ bend that straightens out 
the deflected beam line, see Figure~\ref{fig:full-staging}.
This helps reduce transverse beam size growth in the last dipole.

\Subsection{Optimization Results}
After forty-eight hours, the optimization run described in Section~\ref{setup} completed and the results were analyzed. 
Note, all six objectives were minimized during the optimization run, but it is hard to determine which 
of the thousands of results were the ``best'' per say. This depends on several criteria, which must be 
determined by the experiment. Usually Pareto fronts are used to compare trade-offs,
as done in Chapter~\ref{simulations}, but in the case of a high dimensional problem, such as this, 
no two objectives will visualize all of the available information.

As a work around, several different Pareto fronts were plotted, with the understanding that 
no one plot is a representation of the whole data set.
First, a Pareto front comparing the trade-off between bunch length and transverse beam size was plotted.  
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{images/x_vs_z_pareto_front_Q5}
	\caption{Simulated Pareto front of transverse beam size in x vs. bunch length.
		This data was a result of the simulation setup in Section \ref{setup}.}
	\label{fig:xz-pareto}
\end{figure}
While the beam size data in Figure~\ref{fig:xz-pareto} is promising, the bunch lengths are too long.
At \SI{3}{mm}, less than 60\% of the possible power is generated in the PETS (refer to form factor discussion in Chapter 1). 
The results in the transverse dimension were
more instructive. Two Pareto fronts comparing beam sizes
and momentum in the x and y dimensions are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:tba-paretoxy}.
As expected the beam sizes in the x dimension are larger 
due to the bending elements. This indicates the x dimension will be the 
limiting factor in areas with tight apertures such as the PETS.  
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/xy_vs_pxpy_pareto_front_Q5}
	\caption{Simulated Pareto front of beam size vs. momentum.
		This data was a result of the simulation setup in Section \ref{setup}.}
	\label{fig:tba-paretoxy}
\end{figure}
Note the two curves in Figure~\ref{fig:tba-paretoxy}, may not represent the same 
design variables for a point to point comparison. A Pareto analysis always 
chooses the best points with respect to the objectives chosen. This guarantees no 
relationship between all objectives. 
For example, the smallest beam size in y, at less than \SI{0.35}{mm} on Figure~\ref{fig:tba-paretoxy}, 
may not have the same input parameter settings for the matching solenoid or quad strengths, as the smallest x position 
at a little over \SI{2.5}{mm}. In other words, the best optics scenario for the x dimension
may or may not be the best optics scenario for the y dimension. 

With this in mind, the Pareto front was re-plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:tba-pareto} 
with one key difference. The y values were forced to coincide with the same 
design variables used in the x dimension. The same was done for bunch length.  \lsnote{{\it I am confused here: you say `bunch length' (referring to Fig. 4.20) but the plots don't have the bunch length anywhere on them, only the transverse momentum spread.  Maybe you mislabeled them?  Otherwise the following comment on power generation is not supported.  If the bunch length really is not on figure 4.20 - then what bunch lengths correspond to those data points?  Basically, if not on plot, you need to specifically tell reader what the corresponding bunch lengths were - if only by saying that all points in Figure 4.20 had bunchlength of less than 2mm.}}
Now a true point to point comparison is possible in these plots.
We chose the values of momentum spread to coincide with small horizontal beam size, 
since this was more difficult to achieve than small vertical beam size, see Figure~\ref{fig:tba-paretoxy}. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/xz_vs_px_pareto_front_Q5}%
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/xy_vs_px_pareto_front_Q5}
	\caption{Simulated Pareto front of beam sizes vs. momentum.
		Adjusted to force y beam sizes and bunch length \lsnote{{\it but no bunchlength in plots, so need a comment on that}} to correspond to same design variables 
		as the x beam sizes.
		This data was a result of the simulation setup in Section \ref{setup}.}
	\label{fig:tba-pareto}
\end{figure}
The momentum variance in Figure~\ref{fig:tba-pareto} is small in comparison to 
the beam size variance. The bunch length values are also improved with all but one below \SI{2}{mm}
where 80\% power generation in the PETS is possible. 

Note, the horizontal beam sizes are not as small as in Figure~\ref{fig:xz-pareto}, 
but this is considered acceptable given the improved bunch length values.
There is truly a ``trade-off'' to be made between the two.

design variables and beam sizes for Figure~\ref{fig:tba-pareto}.  \lsnote{{\it There are no beam sizes in the table, except bunch length.  Also, table caption says Input parameters, but the bunch length is not an input parameter.}}

Since 100\% transmission is the main goal at this point, 
the max beam size along the beam line was plotted for these optimized points.
The results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:optresults} are promising, they indicate the optics 
can be well controlled through the kicker, septum, and leading into the staging area.

The best scenario, corresponding to a matching solenoid strength of \SI{197}{A}, was then explored further.
With guidance from some of the failed runs described in Section~\ref{failed}, 
strengths of \SI{-2.0}{A} and \SI{1.25}{A} were chosen respectively for 
quadrupoles 5 and 6. The rest of the beam line was simulated to the PETS location. 
The focus remains on 100\% transmission, 
because that has been the main limiting factor in previous TBA experiments. 
These results are promising for several reasons. 
The two obvious benefits to this solution are transmission and beam size. 
More subtle, but still significant is the value of the quadrupole strengths.
All of the optimized settings in Table~\ref{tab:designopt} are far from the 
extreme limits of the magnets, meaning there is plenty of wiggle room to adjust 
the magnets during an experiment. This is important, because not all effects are 
included in this simulation.

Up to this point, the optimization and and simulations have taken place using
2D field maps and space charge. No coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) effects
were calculated, and asymmetries in the fields are expected to change the 
results as shown earlier in Figure~\ref{fig:beamsize}.
These two effects were left out in early simulations as they significantly 
increase the time to simulation. These effects would lengthen the amount of time 
needed to run the GA to over 4 or 5 days.
Therefore, a 2D study was done first, and the solution checked.
Then another simulation using the same design variables was done that included 
3D RF field maps and CSR effects, see Figure~\ref{fig:3D}. 
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{{images/xy-max-min-optLinac-40nC_IM=197_IBF=478_KQ1=-0.8_KQ2=0.9_KQ3=0.8_KQ4=-1.0_KQ5=-2.0_KQ6=1.25_CSR.stat}.pdf}%

	\label{fig:3D}
\end{figure}
Asymmetries in the RF field maps are causing additional focusing in the horizontal direction
and defocusing in the vertical direction. The optics need to be adjusted to compensate for 3D effects, 
however, the 2D solution indicated that there is plenty of range on the solenoid and quadrupoles to do this.
A scan of the matching solenoid was done to reduce the over focusing in the horizontal direction 
(see the updated 3D beam line simulation in Figure~\ref{fig:adjsol}).

It is important to note the large differences in 2D and 3D results. While 2D work can set a foundation
for beam line studies, it should not be used for comparison to experiment; 
at least in the case of high charge at the AWA. Aside from this insight,
a significant achievement to point out is the absence of quadrupole strength values for the last triplet.
The optimization work was able to find a suitable optics solution without using the last three quadrupoles 
in the beam line. This positions the AWA at a significant advantage when running future TBA experiments.
Not all realistic effects are included in the simulation (i.e. wakefield in the PETS, non-uniform laser profile distribution), 
and this optics solution allows for three more degrees of freedom that can be used during experiments 
to compensate for the differences. In summary, these results indicate the beam line configuration proposed 
can successfully demonstrate fully staged TBA at the AWA.

\Section{Chapter Summary}

Several design exercises took place to determine the TBA layout at the AWA. 
A stripline kicker was designed using first principles and simulations. 
It was fabricated and assembled at ANL with some parts purchased from third party vendors.
The kickers ability to maintain high voltage was tested with the help of staff members at the APS.
They also aided  in performing a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) measurement to characterize 
the impedance of the kicker, feedthrough, and cable connections. 
A mismatch at the connection point between the kicker plates and feedthroughs was discovered.
While the mismatch reduces the available voltage between the plates, it is not a danger to 
the equipment or beam. After the two outside vacuum tests, the kicker was installed on 
the AWA drive line. It was tested with \SI{30}{nC} beams. 
The beam deflection and angle due to the kicker were measured and 
compared to first order, and showed that the kicker performance meets beam dynamics specifications. 
The remainder of the beam line is awaiting installation. 

Further design work included determination of beam line input parameter settings (incorporating 
mechanical and hardware constraints) that achieve beam transmission through the power extractor (PETS).
Initially, a point to point matrix calculation was done to determine if the 
beam size entering the first four quadrupoles could be maintained near the kicker.
This exercise resulted in determining that the field strength needed for a point to point beam transfer is \SI{\pm 4.14}{T/m}, 
which is well below the hardware limit of \SI{\pm9}{T/m}. 
Next, a beam line optimization was done using the built in genetic algorithm in OPAL.  
Six design variables and five objectives were used. 
The results are plotted, and confirm the beam line geometry can deliver 
a \SI{40}{nC} beam to the PETS location with 100\% transmission.
Future work includes checking the optimization results for the full beam line against beam measurements.  
This requires that the remaining hardware be installed.  
It is expected that the design work presented will enable successful beam transport through the new beam line, 
and that in turn will enable demonstration of fully independent staging for a two-beam acceleration scheme.
