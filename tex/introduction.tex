A new generation of accelerators dedicated to High Energy Physics
(HEP), would likely be of the TeV scale. Reduction in the size and cost
of such machines is key to their feasibility, and can be accomplished
through accelerator technology R\&D. Investigation into a 
high gradient candidate for future HEP machines is an active research area
at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility. A
short pulse, two-beam acceleration (TBA) scheme using 
wakefield power extractors, and accelerating structures made 
of metallic materials was demonstrated~\cite{recent-tba}. 
A goal of the AWA group is to demonstrate fully staged TBA, 
achieving a gradient of 250 MV/m. If successful, this would
be the only facility in the world capable of such gradients used for
acceleration of a beam.

TBA requires a drive beam to pass through a decelerating structure and
loss of energy through wakefield generation. The electromagnetic wake
is coupled from the decelerator into an accelerating structure, where
the electric field is used to accelerate a second beam. 
This requires two complete and separate beamlines 
operating synchronously with each other.  
The wakefield structures can be metallic or dielectric on either beam line. 
Dielectric structures, having no irises, are simple to manufacture and have demonstrated
high gradient capability at \SI{100}{MV/m} \cite{WeiPaper}. 

The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) collaboration, proposes a similar TBA scheme with
a \SI{240}{ns} pulse design. This limits the acceleration gradient
to roughly \SI{150}{MV/m} at room temperature due to rf breakdown \cite{CLICdesignReport}.
Higher gradients could be reached when driven by a very short drive
beam pulse, such as the 20ns pulse length proposed by AWA \cite{WeiPaper}. 
While the peak power and gradients are considerably larger in the short pulse scheme, 
the average power is still feasible and within current technology capabilities.
While the two groups vary on approach, they agree that TBA would 
require less infrastructure when constructing a linear TeV scale machine, 
versus the cost of more conventional technology. 

For example, a case study was done comparing the infrastructure 
needed when using traditional \SI{50}{MW} klystron sources.
It would take roughly 35,000 klystrons to construct a linear machine to deliver the same 
\SI{9.2}{TW} power required in the CLIC design specification reports \cite{CLICdesignReport}. 
With TBA, CLIC projected a \SI{3}{TeV} energy at a length of \SI{48}{km}.
%In contrast to CLIC's 48 km projected machine length needed to reach \SI{3}{TeV}, 
In contrast, the Next Linear Collider (NLC) collaboration projected a \SI{1}{TeV} machine 
with length \SI{26}{km}, using X-band klystrons \cite{NLC}. 
This drastic difference occurs in the infrastructure needed to generate and transfer
RF power in the two cases. In TBA, a high charge bunch train is generated in 
a photoinjector and propagated down stream using conventional technology 
(accelerating structures, quads, dipoles, etc). After it has reached the design energy
is focused into specially designed wakefield structures (decelerating structure).
The RF is then generated in the decelerating structure and supplied to the witness 
beam line through a waveguide connection. This has two benefits over traditional klystron technology.
One, you can have structures at higher frequencies (any multiple of the machine frequency), 
which helps push the gradient. Readily available and production klystrons are limited in this aspect.
Second, all the waveguide infrastructure needed to connect a klystron to the accelerating 
structures is eliminated. There is the initial cost near the photoinjector, 
but downstream, much of the infrastructure costs are eliminated.
Theoretically, TBA can deliver the same amount of power as conventional methods with less 
infrastructure, and therefore lower cost, in the case of a large machine. 

Before a detailed understanding of the power and infrastructure trade offs 
can be obtained, the feasibility of staged TBA must be be demonstrated.
Demonstration of staging is especially important, 
as no high energy machine can be built without staging.
Staging is the ability to use two successive accelerating modules to synchronously accelerate 
the same particle bunch. While simple in principle, the difficulties 
in achieving staging should not be underestimated. 
Demonstration of staging proves that a TBA scheme can be scaled to high energies, and whether it is 
feasible to use such methods. Single stage TBA, and staging 
in a simplified scheme have been demonstrated at the AWA in 2016 \cite{tba2017}.
In the simplified scheme, both bunch trains travel through two decelerating stages.
This causes energy loss in stage 1 as the the second bunch train travels to stage 2.
\nrnote{add figure here to show difference between simplified and full staging}

Fully staged TBA introduces a fast rise time kicker
and subsequent dogleg-like beam line. In this scenario, bunch trains can be 
be directed to two independent decelerating structures. 
Therefore you can extract the maximum amount of power in each stage.
Experimental preparations, design, optimization, 
and initial testing of the fully staged beam line
is the subject of this thesis. 

Experimental work included UV laser pulse train improvement, 
which improves the RF power generation in the wakefield structures.
\nrnote{I will add more details to this summary paragraph}
An image processing script was written in Python to analyze YAG screen data. 
A vast number of simulations were performed in OPAL-t~\cite{opal}.
The photoinjector was optimized for \SI{40}{nC}, 
which improved the beam parameters entering the TBA experimental area.
Simulations of the TBA beam line were done to ensure transmission at
the wakefield structure. Optimization of the optics was done using 
a genetic algorithm.
