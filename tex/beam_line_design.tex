\Chapter{Beam Line Design}%________________________________
Using the foundations set in Chapters 2 and 3, a beam line design for staged 
two beam acceleration was laid out and simulated. 
.....more intro here....

\Section{Matrix Formalism}
 To reduce the number of free parameters quickly, without using expensive PIC simulations, 
 the transfer matrix of the beam line was considered. Starting at the end of the linac, 
 we consider the first four quadrupoles before the kicker. All the quadruple strengths and
 distances between the quadrupoles are parameters under consideration. To reduce the number
 of variables from 8 to 4, we use the telescope module as described by K. Brown in \cite{brown}.
