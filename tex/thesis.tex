%%% Abstract %%%
\begin{abstract}           % abstract environment, this is optional
	\par Two beam acceleration (TBA) is a candidate for future high energy physics machines and FEL user facilities. 
	This is a scheme in which one electron accelerator transports and supplies the RF power needed for acceleration
	on a secondary and independent 'witness' accelerator. This technology is attractive for its potential to 
	improve the efficient and simplicity of large scale machines At the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility (AWA), 
	research into this potential accelerator scheme is ongoing. Completed experiments include a simplified staging set up, 
	where high-charge, 65 MeV drive bunch trains were injected from the RF photoinjector into decelerating 
	structures to generate a few hundred MW's of RF power. This RF power was transferred through an 
	RF waveguide to accelerating structures that were used to accelerate the witness beam. 
	Staging refers to the sequential acceleration (energy gain) in two or more structures on the witness beam line. 
	
	The main limitation in past experiments was difficulty achieving 100\% transmission in the 
	second stage which resulted in lower power generation. 
	AWA plans to demonstrate fully staged TBA, which requires a separate beam line for each decelerating/accelerating pair.
	In this thesis, design specifications and initial hardware tests  needed for a new, independent beamline for TBA was done. 
	Simulations of the drive line were done using the code OPAL.
	Since OPAL was new to the AWA group, a benchmark comparison with ASTRA and GPT was done to validate initial results. 
	Then two optimization algorithms were investigated and used to optimize the drive line at 40 nC.
	Comparison of results between the two algorithms were done, with no major discrepancies found.
	Then large scale and parallel optimizations were done for the optics configuration in the fully staged TBA beam line design.  
	
	A kicker was designed and incorporated on the drive beam line to accomplish a modular design so that 
	each accelerating structure can be independently powered by a separate drive beam. 
	Experimental measurements of the kicker indicate the angle increases linearly with the supplied voltage, 
	and the angle achieved meets the design requirements for fully staged TBA. 
	Optics optimization was done to minimize the beam size at the center of the 
	decelerating structures to ensure good charge transmission. 
	The resulting design will be the basis for proof of principle experiments that will take place at the AWA facility.

\Appendix{Gun Simulations with Varied Voltage and Laser Radius}\label{gunsims}
The gun voltage was varied in Chapter~\ref{chp:4}. 
The symmetric and asymmetric laser radius effects were simulated.

\Appendix{How to build OPAL on Bebop at ANL} \label{build}
This set of instructions is tailored to the bebop cluster at ANL. 
Intel compilers and intel-MPI were used to build OPAL and all 
the libraries it is dependent on.
\begin{enumerate}[label=Step \arabic*:]
	\item Load modules 

I purge modules first, this will force an error message if any changes
to the system modules occur.
\begin{lstlisting}
	module purge
	module load intel
	module load intel-mpi 
	module load cmake 
	module load gmp   
	module load mpfr  
	module load mpc   
	module load hdf5   
	module load gsl   
	module load intel-mkl
	module load szip
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Set environment variables for compilers 
 
These variables point to intel compilers. 
\begin{lstlisting}
CC=mpiicc;CXX=mpiicpc;F90=ifort;F77=ifort
export CC CXX F90 F77
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Set environment variables for self built libraries.
    
I built these libraries separately because they were not available as 
modules on the cluster. 

\begin{lstlisting}
	export PATH="/blues/gpfs/home/neveu/git/H5hut-2.0.0rc3/build:${PATH}"
	
	export H5HUT_HOME=$HOME/git/H5hut-2.0.0rc3/build_intel
	export H5HUT_PREFIX=$H5HUT_HOME
	export H5HUT_DIR=$H5HUT_HOME
	export H5HUT_INCLUDE_DIR=$H5HUT_HOME/include
	export H5HUT_LIBRARY_DIR=$H5HUT_HOME/lib
	
	export BOOST_HOME=$HOME/git/boost_1_62_0/build/
	export BOOST_DIR=$BOOST_HOME
	export BOOST_PREFIX=$BOOST_HOME
	export BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR=$BOOST_HOME/include
	export BOOST_LIBRARY_DIR=$BOOST_HOME/lib
	export BOOST_ROOT=/home/neveu/git/boost_1_62_0/
	echo $BOOST_ROOT
	echo $BOOST_DIR
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Call cmake 
    
There are two cmake calls I use depending on if I'm building for 
BDW (\verb|-axCORE-AVX2|) or KNL (\verb|-axMIC-AVX512|) architecture. 
    
\begin{lstlisting}
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/neveu/software/opal-1.9/bdw -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-lsz -axCORE-AVX2" ..
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Call make, then make install
I usually call make with a large number of cores to speed up the compilation.    
\begin{lstlisting}
	make -j 30 
	make install
\end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}
